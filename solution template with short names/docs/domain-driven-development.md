# Domain Driven Design

## Visual Studio Solution Structure
When organizing projects in a Visual Studio solution following Domain-Driven Design (DDD), it's common to structure the projects to reflect the architecture's layers and bounded contexts:

### Domain Layer:
[SolutionName].Domain: This project would contain all your entities, value objects, aggregates, domain events, and business logic. No external dependencies should be in this project.

### Application Layer:
[SolutionName].Application: This would contain application services, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), and interfaces for repositories and other infrastructural concerns.

### Infrastructure Layer:
[SolutionName].Infrastructure: This project would hold concrete implementations for your repositories, data access code (e.g., Entity Framework configurations), and integrations with other systems or third-party libraries.

### UI Layer:
If you have a web application: [SolutionName].Web
If it's an API: [SolutionName].Api
For a desktop application: [SolutionName].Desktop

### Tests:
[SolutionName].Domain.Tests: Unit tests for domain logic.
[SolutionName].Application.Tests: Tests for the application layer, often involving mocking infrastructural concerns.
[SolutionName].Infrastructure.Tests: Tests for your infrastructure code, which may include integration tests.
[SolutionName].Web.Tests or [SolutionName].Api.Tests: Tests for your UI or API layer.

## Object naming

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the terms "models" and "entities" have specific meanings and connotations:

### Entities:
These are domain objects that have a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. This means that the identity of an entity is crucial, and even if other attributes change, it remains the same entity. For example, a User with a unique user ID or an Order with a unique order number can be entities. Their identity is crucial to distinguish them from other users or orders, respectively.

### Domain Model:
This represents the conceptual foundation of your system and consists of entities, value objects, aggregates, services, and other domain components. The term "model" in DDD encompasses more than just individual data objects. It represents the entire set of domain concepts, behaviors, and relationships.

- If you're referring to objects with identity: use Entities.
- If you're referring to the overall conceptual system: use Domain Model.- 
- If you're referring to objects without identity: consider Value Objects.

It's essential to use this terminology consistently, especially when collaborating with others, to ensure clarity and avoid confusion.
